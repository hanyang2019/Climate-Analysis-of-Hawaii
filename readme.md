## Temperature Analysis I

| Test           | P value                | 
| -------------  |:----------------------:| 
| Paired T test  | 6.580289883689127e-41  | 

Paire T test was used to comopare June and December temperatures in Hawaii. The mean of all measurements at all stations was used to represent daily tempperature. Because we were comparing two measurements of one spot at different times, which fits the definition of a paried T test. P value is less than 0.05 indicating a significant difference existed between tempratures in June and December.
